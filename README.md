## Motivation & Goals

Writing a high-quality literature review is tedious and time-consuming. This project aims to:

- Automate or assist in identifying relevant papers  
- Summarize key contributions, gaps, and themes  
- Generate a draft or skeleton of a literature review  
- Help researchers speed up the review process without sacrificing rigor  

Your goal is **not** to replace human judgment, but to provide a scaffold that you can refine.

## Features

- Fetch / retrieve relevant papers given keywords or seed papers  
- Summarize individual papers (abstracts, key contributions, limitations)  
- Cluster / group papers by themes / topics  
- Synthesize across papers (common trends, disagreements, gaps)  
- Generate a structured draft (introduction, thematic sections, future directions)  
- Optionally, interactive feedback / refinement (if you built a UI)

## Architecture & Modules

Hereâ€™s a proposed (or existing) modular breakdown:

| Module / File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Entry point, argument parsing / orchestration |
| `retriever.py` | Logic to search or fetch paper metadata / full texts |
| `summarizer.py` | Summarize papers into concise descriptions |
| `clustering.py` | Group papers by themes, keywords, topics |
| `synthesizer.py` | Produce higher-level narrative across clusters |
| `formatter.py` | Turn the output into a nicely formatted draft (Markdown, LaTeX, .docx) |
| `utils.py` | Helper functions, I/O, text cleaning, prompt templates |
| `config.py` | Default settings & parameters |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.env` | Secret keys, API credentials |
| `.gitignore` | Ignored files (e.g. `.env`, downloaded PDFs) |

Adjust this table to reflect your actual file structure.
